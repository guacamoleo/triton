/*******************************************************************************
  Relatively simple machine model which enabled the scheduler passes to create a
  "not bad" op schedule optimized for both performance and resource allocation.
  To achieve this, the scheduler needs to know things like how many independent
  DotOps should there be between a LocalLoadOp and it's dependent DotOp. It is
  assumed that DotOps are the most important, that memory ops whcih feed them
  are in a close second, and all other ops are tertiary in importance. Therefore
  it essentially only model ops as being dot, load/stores, nop, and other.

  To achieve this there is
  (1) MachineModel which stores basic properties of the most important ops,
  such as how many cycles does it take to execute, and which can co-execute.
  (2) MachineState tracker which stores, during scheduling, the hypothetical
  state of the machine to know which ops are best scheduled next.
  For example, when a dot is scheduled BottomUp, store at what time can the
  dependent LocalLoadOp be scheduled.

  However, to give even an approximate interleaving of memory op with dot
  and other ops, we need some minimal information regarding the hardware
  execution of the ops.
  Information needed to schedule ops:
  - LDS read data latency.
  - LDS write data latency.
  - Buffer load data latency.
  - Buffer load data latency.
  - Cycles to execute an mfma, and how many of those cycles can
    another non-mfma op co-execute?

  MachineModel Op Properties
  Basic properties of the hardware instruction which the ttg ops
  best map to.
  For example, mfma_16x16x16 on MI300X
  - Takes 4 cycles to issue.
  - Also keeps the mfma pipe busy for an additional 12 cycles
  Therefore 4 back-to-back mfmas will take 4*16=64 cycles since
  they're each taking up 16 cycles of the mfma pipe.
  And 1 mfma, 1 lds op, 1 mfma, 1 other op only takes 4*16=32 cycles
  since the mfmas took 16 cycles but the other ops mapped to different
  hardware pipes and could be co-executed for free.

  This complexity of modeling co-execution of ops is necessary
  for determining, e.g., at the top of a loop, how many LoadOps
  can be grouped with how many DotOps, since the LoadOps need
  to increment their addresses and then can co-execute with
  the DotOps.

/*
  MachineState tracks what has and will happen on the GPU as a result of the
  scheduling process.

  The primary functions called by the scheduler are
  - scheduleOp(op) which updates the machine state based on the op being
  scheduled.
  - getCyclesUntilOpReady(op) which return how soon the machine will be ready
      to schedule the op (without wasting cycles).
  - updateOpDataReady(op, op) which allows the scheduler to tell the machine
  that there is a non def/use dependency (e.g. bar) which requires one op to
  wait for the other.

  The machine state consists of pipeReadyCycle[pipe] and opDataReadyCycle[op]
  which track when these resources will be ready. pipeReadyCycle[pipe] tracks
  how long ago the last op was scheduled to the pipe and therefore when will the
  pipe be ready for the next op. E.g. after scheduling an mfma, the mfma pipe
  will busy for several cycles but other pipes (lds or valu) are free to
  execute. opDataReadyCycle[op] stores when data will be ready for memory ops,
  e.g. after a LocalLoadOp it's children won't have their data until X cycles
  later.

  Because actual machine execution is always TopDown, but scheduling can be
  either direction, the above state has slightly different meanings based on
  direction.

  (1) TopDown Pipe Example:
  pipeReadyCycle[pipe] tracks at which cycle the pipe will be ready,
    which is the cycle it was last used + prev op's pipeBusyAfterSeq.
  E.g. currentCycle=16 scheduleOp(mfma)
    - currentCycle advances to 20 b/c mfma seqBusy=4.
    - pipeReadyCycle[mfma] set to 32 b/c mfma's pipeBusyAfterSeq=16.
      Later, getCyclesUntilPipeReadyForOp() will know that the pipe
      is ready at t=32.

  (2) BottomUp Pipe Example:
  pipeReadyCycle[pipe] tracks which cycle the pipe was last used;
    we can't add the pipeBusyAfterSeq for the op which comes above it
    since we haven't determined it yet for BottomUp.
  E.g. currentCycle=16 scheduleOp(mfma)
    - currentCycle advances to 20 b/c mfma seqBusy=4.
    - pipeReadyCycle[mfma] set to 20 b/c only stores last used.
  Later, getCyclesUntilPipeReadyForOp() will know that the pipe was last
  used at t=20, then it will determine if the next op scheduled will be
  done with the pipe by t=20 based on it's pipeBusyAfterSeq.

  (3) TopDown Data Example:
    opDataReadyCycle tracks at which future cycle the data for an op will be
    ready. E.g. currentCycle=16, ds_read.seqBusy=4, scheduleOp(load) will record
  op->children need to wait until t=16+4+updateOpDataReady(load).

  (4) BottomUp Data Example:
    Same as TopDown, except that insteady of recording when children will be
    ready, it records when parents (the load ops) will be ready to be issued.
